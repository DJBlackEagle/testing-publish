## Package.json Scripts

This section explains the purpose and functionality of the various scripts defined
in the `package.json` file. These scripts are used to streamline tasks such as
cleaning, building, testing, linting, formatting, and preparing the project.

### Cleaning Scripts

- **clean**  
  Runs multiple cleaning tasks sequentially. It removes build artifacts, cached files,
  and node modules by calling the following sub-scripts:
  - **clean:artifacts**: Deletes the `./.artifacts` directory.
  - **clean:build**: Removes the `./dist` directory where the build output is stored.
  - **clean:cache**: Deletes the `./.cache` directory.
  - **clean:node**: Removes the `./node_modules` directory.

### Build Script

- **build**  
  First, it cleans the build directory (using `clean:build`) and then compiles
  the project using the TypeScript compiler with the configuration specified in `tsconfig.build.json`.

### Testing Scripts

- **test**  
  Executes the test suite using Jest.
- **test:coverage**  
  Runs Jest with a coverage flag to generate code coverage reports.
- **test:watch**  
  Runs Jest in watch mode, automatically re-running tests when files change.
- **test:watch:onlychanged**  
  Runs Jest in watch mode but only tests files that have been modified.

### Linting Scripts

- **lint**  
  Runs ESLint on the entire project to analyze code for potential issues and to
  enforce code style.
- **lint:file**  
  Similar to `lint`, but can be targeted to specific files or directories.
- **lint:fix**  
  Runs ESLint with the `--fix` option to automatically correct fixable issues.
- **lint:fix:file**  
  Similar to `lint:fix`, but intended for specific files.

### Formatting Scripts

- **format**  
  Uses Prettier to check the code formatting across the project.
- **format:file**  
  Similar to `format`, but targets specific files.
- **format:fix**  
  Runs Prettier with the `--write` option to automatically format the code.
- **format:fix:file**  
  Similar to `format:fix`, but intended for specific files.

### Preparation Script

- **prepare**  
  Sets up Husky by installing Git hooks. These hooks enforce code quality and
  commit message standards before commits are finalized.

### Validation Script

- **validate**  
  A comprehensive script that performs a series of checks:
  1. Runs the linting process.
  2. Checks code formatting.
  3. Executes tests using a specific Jest configuration (`jest.config.workflow-ci.mjs`).

## Workflow Configuration

Our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is configured to ensure that the project
maintains high quality through automated testing, linting, formatting, and
security scans.

### Automatic Dependency Updates

The project uses an automated workflow with **Dependabot** to keep dependencies
up to date and ensure security updates are applied in a timely manner.

- Dependencies are checked for updates **monthly**, including **GitHub Actions**
  and **npm packages**.
- Critical security updates are applied automatically.
- Dependabot checks the defined package sources at regular intervals and creates
  **pull requests** for new versions.
- Changes can be manually reviewed, merged, or declined.
- Unwanted updates can be closed or ignored through Dependabot configuration.
- Pull requests are assigned to a responsible maintainer and labeled for easy identification.
- Commit messages follow a consistent pattern for better traceability.

Dependabot ensures that the project remains up to date and secure while allowing
control over updates through configurable settings.

### CodeQL Security Analysis

The project uses **CodeQL** to detect vulnerabilities and potential security risks
in the codebase. This automated workflow ensures continuous security analysis.

- CodeQL runs on **pushes to `main`** and **pull requests**.
- A scheduled scan is executed **weekly**.
- The analysis covers **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** code.
- The repository is checked out, and CodeQL is initialized.
- Code is analyzed using CodeQL’s security rules.
- Findings are reported under the repository’s **Security tab** on GitHub.

By detecting security vulnerabilities before they reach production, the workflow
provides automated security scanning without manual intervention and ensures
compliance with best security practices. The CodeQL workflow helps maintain a
secure codebase by identifying risks early in the development cycle.

### Issue and Pull Request Cleanup

The project uses an automated stale issue and pull request cleanup workflow to
ensure that inactive issues and PRs do not clutter the repository.

- Issues become stale after **30 days** of inactivity and are labeled as `stale`.
- Stale issues are closed automatically after **7 days** if no activity occurs.
- Pull requests become stale after **30 days** and are closed after **10 days**
  if no further action is taken.
- Issues and PRs with specific labels (e.g., `no-stale`, `help-wanted`) are
  exempt from this process.

This automation helps keep the repository manageable and ensures that active
discussions are prioritized.

### Label Synchronization

The project uses an automated workflow to ensure consistent issue and pull
request labels. This synchronization process helps maintain structured issue
management and simplifies repository maintenance.

- The workflow runs when changes are pushed to the **main** branch that modify
  the `.github/labels.yml` file.
- Labels defined in `.github/labels.yml` are automatically synchronized across
  the repository.
- Synchronization can also be triggered manually using **workflow dispatch**.
- Ensures a standardized and structured issue labeling system.
- Prevents label inconsistencies when working with multiple contributors.
- Reduces manual label management effort.

By automating label synchronization, the project maintains consistency and
reduces manual work, making issue tracking more efficient.
